#    """Set up a callback and its parameters in a easy-to-pass way.
#
#    An object which represents a calback, including its positional and keyword
#    parameters.
#    This object is designed for asynchronous operations.
#
#    It is easy to pass more partial parameters to the function, at any stage of
#    the asynchronous process.
#    Multiple callbacks can be chained after this one, each one with different
#    parameters.
#
#    At the end of the process a result can be set. The result will be set on
#    each of the chained callbacks as well. The result set to the callbacks is
#    either the original result set to the root callback, or any result returned
#    by the parent callback.
#
#    The definition of the callback needs to have a "result_" keyword argument
#    which will receive the result of the asynchronous process, an exception
#    instance if the process resulted in an error, or None if no result has been
#    passed.
#
#    If the callback returns a result (i.e. a non-None value), this result will
#    be passed to all the chained callback.
#    The propagation of the result is only between the parent callback and the
#    chained ones. If any chained callback returns a result, it won't influence
#    any sibling chained callback.
#
#    For example:
#    For simplicity assume that baz, gna are defined callbacks which do some
#    work and do not return anything (i.e. None)
#
#    def foo(arg1, result_):
#        # do something
#        return 'new result!'
#
#    def bar(result_):
#        # do some more work
#        return 'further result!'
#
#    root_cb = CallbackChain(foo, 1)
#
#    root_child1 = CallbackChain(bar)
#    root.cb.put(root_child1)
#
#    child1_firstborn = CallbackChain(gna, somekw='wow')
#    child1_firstborn.append_partial_params('somepositional',
#                                           anotherkw='another!')
#    root_child1.put(child1_firstborn)
#
#    root_child2 = CallbackChain(baz)
#    root_cb.put(root_child2)
#
#
#
#    root_cb.set_result('result')
#
#    #  this code will create a call tree like:
#    #    root (foo(1, result_=<theresult>)
#    #         \-> root_child1 bar(result_=<theresult>)
#    #                \-> child2_child gna('somepositional', somekw='wow',
#    #                                     anotherkw='another!',
#    #                                     result_=<theresult>)
#    #         \-> root_child2 baz(result_<theresult>)
#    #
#    #  with root having a set result, produce by an async process.
#
#    root()  # run root callback: a call to foo(1, result_='result')
#
#    # at this point foo has been executed. since it returned something, the
#    # status for the chained calls is now its retuned value: 'new result!'
#
#    for child in root:
#        child()
#        for grandchild in child:
#            grandchild()
#
#    # the loop will call in this order:
#    # bar(result_='new result!') -> returns 'further result!'
#    # gna('somepositional', somekw='wow', anotherkw='another!',
#    #     result_='further result!')
#    # baz('new result!')
#    #
#    # note that baz has been called with the result returned by root. This is
#    # because the scope of the reuslt propagation is only to the callback
#    # subtree (chained callbacks, or children as called in this example).
#    # baz is called by root_child2, which is in fact a chained callback added
#    # to root, and for this reason it will inherit root's result.
